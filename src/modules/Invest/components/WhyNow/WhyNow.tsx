              Prominent game developers and studios, including but not limited
              to Epic Games, Enix Games, and Ubisoft, are proactively allocating
              resources towards the integration and adoption of Web3 games and
              blockchain technology. Our partnership with TeamBDS is another
              proof that traditional esports players are ready to embrace web3â€™s
              innovation.

              XBorg has been approached by VCs showing interest, and with the
              the allocation for the Seed round has gotten smaller. It is
              important to us that our community is able to enter at the
              earliest round, and therefore, we are opening the round now before
              the allocations are complete.
